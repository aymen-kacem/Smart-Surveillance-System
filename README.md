📷 Real-Time Activity Detection with YOLO 🚀
Welcome to the Real-Time Activity Detection project! 🎉 This Python script uses the powerful YOLO model to detect objects and activities in real-time. Whether it’s spotting a running person, detecting a fall, or identifying a dangerous object like a knife, this project has got you covered — with instant email alerts! 📧

✨ Features
✅ Real-Time Object Detection
Detect objects like people and dangerous items using YOLOv5.

🏃 Activity Monitoring

Running: Detects fast movement! 🏃‍♂️
Falling: Alerts you when someone is lying near the ground. ⛑️
Loitering: Flags prolonged presence in one area. 🕒
🔪 Danger Detection
Identifies dangerous objects like knives for safety alerts. ⚠️

📧 Email Notifications
Stay updated with instant alerts sent to your inbox. 💌

🛠️ Setup
Clone the Repo

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/activity-detection-yolo.git
cd activity-detection-yolo
Install Dependencies

bash
Copier le code
pip install opencv-python ultralytics
Download YOLO Weights
Place the yolov5s.pt file in the project directory.

Configure Email Alerts
Update the following in the script:

python
Copier le code
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'your-email@example.com'  # Your email
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-password'          # App password for Gmail
TO_EMAIL = 'recipient-email@example.com'  # Alert recipient
🚀 Usage
Run the Script

bash
Copier le code
python activity_detection.py
Watch the Magic! 🪄

The webcam will stream real-time detection.
Activities like running, falling, and loitering will be flagged.
Alerts will be sent to your configured email! 📤
Exit Anytime
Hit q to stop the application. 🛑

📜 How It Works
🔍 Object Detection
YOLOv5 analyzes each frame from your webcam and identifies objects.

🧠 Activity Analysis

Tracks movements to calculate speed and position.
Detects abnormal activities like running, falling, or loitering.
📧 Email Alerts
Sends an alert when specific events occur, such as:

A person is detected running or falling.
A dangerous object like a knife is identified.
🌟 What’s Next?
✨ Add more activities to monitor!
📲 Integrate SMS or push notifications for faster alerts.
📊 Generate logs or statistics for analysis.

🛡️ Safety First!
This project ensures rapid response in critical situations by combining real-time analysis with instant alerts. Perfect for personal safety, surveillance, and more. 🚔
